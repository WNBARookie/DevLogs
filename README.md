# DevLogs

**DevLogs** is a full-stack application built with **React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB** that helps developers of all experience levels track their growth across both technical and non-technical areas.

The goal is to provide a single place to organize projects, reflect on progress, and generate summaries that can be used for personal growth or professional purposes (e.g., portfolio updates, performance reviews).
