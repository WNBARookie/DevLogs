# DevLogs

This is an app made with the MEAN stack. The goal of it is to keep track of developer's progress on different categories of their development related things. For each category, a user can create projects and for each project, they'll be able to keep track of all the items they've done related to it. Also at the project level, they will be able to generate a summary of their progress as well as a timeline. The goal is to better help a developer keep track of things they've done so they can reflect for personal or professional purpposes.
